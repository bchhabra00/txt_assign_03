JavaScript variables can belong to the local or global scope.
Local space includes that define inside a function.
Global variables can be made local (private) with closures.

To understand the local and global space,consider following two examples:
Example1:

let my global="Global Variable";
function(){
let my local="local variable";
console.log(my local)
console.log(my global)
}
Output is:
Global vrariable
local variale

Example2:

let my global="Global Variable";
function(){
let my local="local variable";

}
console.log(my local)
console.log(my global)

Output is:

undefined
Global variable

Because the global scope outside the function does not have access to local variable.

In order to make local variable a part of global scope,we can use window object.To illustrate consider following example:
Example:

let my global="Global Variable";
function(){
window.my local="local variable";

}
console.log(my local)
console.log(my global)

Output is :
local variable
Global Variable

At last When there are nested function it creates a scope chain,to understand consider following example:le

let myvar="A global variable";
function Level3(){
    function level2(){
       function level1(){
             console.log(myvar);
                        }
                level1();
                     }
                level2();
               }
             level3();

Output is:
A global variable.

Explanation :In this example it looks  for "myvar" under level 2 scope first and then level3 and it keeps going to its upper function until it founds a value.


---If there was "myvar" variable in each fuction it would have displayed that one which is closest to it.---See the following example:

let myvar="A global variable";
function Level3(){
     let myvar="A level3 local variable";
    function level2(){
       let myvar="A level2 local variable";
       function level1(){
             console.log(myvar);
                        }
                level1();
                     }
                level2();
               }
             level3();
 OUTPUT IS:

 level2 local variable

To sum up :
A closure is a connection between function scope and scope of its parent..All closures are intrinsically tied to its parent.
